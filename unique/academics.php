							<h3 style="margin:0!important;" ><span>Early years section </span> Chreche - Nursery 2	</h3>
							<h3><span>Age: 0 Months - 5 years </span> 	</h3>
							<p>In the Early Years section, we promote our pupils’ excellence through our robust curriculum, which is a blend of the Nigerian and British Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) curriculum. In addition, the pupils are equipped with the necessary soft skills required to navigate and impact the society positively, therefore making them wholesome individuals. Like always we ensure that the pupils have the opportunity to maximize their individual progress towards the early learning goals and at the same time have fun while at it.	</p>
							<p>
Thus, every session is packed with fun and exciting learning activities using the EYFS teaching methods for best practices and activities across the prime areas of learning, personal, social and emotional development. Our state of the art Crèche (Purity) is a safe activity based environment for your child to play, learn and explore under the supervision of certified child care minders and health workers.
Some of the activities in the Crèche include music and singing, storytelling, sand and water play, educational games and toys. suitable for all age groups. 	</p>
<p>
In our Reception(Unity) class we have quality EYFS activities which helps in building a solid foundation for the child’s mental, emotional, physical and social development that prepare them for the next level of education. In addition, we help to develop the child’s social skills, which helps them not only to interact with their peers but also the grownups around them.	</p>
<p>
In the Pre-Nursery (Peace &amp; Hope) classes, the activities introduced to the pupils avail them the opportunity for the discovery of new experiences, new friends while maintaining a balance in listening, following directions, participating in group tasks and working independently. Finally in the Nursery classes, the pupils are groomed and introduced to other skills in addition to the academics activities. They are taught the necessary culinary and crafts skills as well as etiquettes required for day to day living via simulation of these work or activity based centres.
